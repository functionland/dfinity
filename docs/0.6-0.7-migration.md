# Migration guide for moving Frontend apps from `dfx` 0.6.\* to 0.7.\*

## Agent/Actor

Previously, we relied on the built-in `bootstrap` lib to provide the initial loading DOM and `window` object, and the canister interfaces were imported from `ic:canisters/canister_name`.

Now the DOM and `window` are populated by a Service Worker and we build our own `Actor` and `HttpAgent` (with tools provided by `@dfinity` packages) to interact with canisters. Canister interfaces are now imported from `dfx-generated/canister_name` and are used with the `Actor` constructor to generate the canister service.

These changes also allowed us to remove the legacy dependency on `ic-polyfill`.

## Considerations

- `dfx.json`'s frontend entrypoint now expects an HTML file, which makes `HTMLWebpackPlugin` (or equivalent in your build tool) helpful for injecting your build output into the HTML entry file
- Using a separate dev server is encouraged, but make sure to pass that server's port to the `HttpAgent` used to set up your canister's `Actor`
- TypeScript definitions are generated by non-asset canisters from their candid interfaces, allowing direct importing from the new `dfx-generated/canister_name` path
- File chunking, browser routing, and traditional asset access are now native to the IC, so there is no longer a need to bundle a single JS file, use hash routing, or parse images from byte arrays. This also means that code-split bundles work!
- Source assets over 2MB are automatically chunked
- Use JS built-in `BigInt` instead of legacy `BigNumber` lib
